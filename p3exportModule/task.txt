2. Write a kernel module that exports a function myexport(),invoke myexport()
   function from other module (dependent module).
   
   Verify the following:
a) Observe meta files generated when the first module (exportmod.c) is built
   --exportmod.mod.c
   --Module.symvers

b) Observe files of dependent module (depmod2.c)
   --depmod2.mod.c
   --Module.symvers

c) Try building dependent module and load it.

Verify using lsmod and dmesg

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results:
--------

a) No Signatures for the Exported Symbols in the exportmod.mod.c.
   It is a header file for the .ko
   The Module.symvers file contains the linkage signatures of the exported 
   symbols.

b) No Signatures for the symbols used from other modules are found in the 
   depmod2.mod.c. Instead the __symbol_get() and __symbol_put() linkage 
   signature is found.

c) The depmod2.mod.c always gets loaded. It then searches for the exported 
   symbols in memory. If they are not found then it reports that and continues
   execution. It is runtime loading of symbols.
   If the symbols are already resident in memory then they are linked at 
   runtime and are resolved.
